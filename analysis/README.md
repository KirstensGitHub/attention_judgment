This directory contains:
- data for each set of experiments (1-8)
- code to analyze all experimental data
  
In addition to testing subjects in the 8 experiments, and collecting experimental data from them, we also gave the subjects a brief post-experiment questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire are also available here (at the bottom of each subject's csv file). 

Note that the repository contains 20 participant files for each experiment. These are either unique participants, or participants who completed two of our experiments in a testing session. The only participants we did not include in the dataset were those who experienced issues (computer or experimenter error) during data collection (for either/any experiment). In one case, a participant finished two tasks to completion, but after restarting one part way through; in this case, we retained the data from the single task completed as intended.
