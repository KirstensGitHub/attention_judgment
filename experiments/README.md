This directory contains the experiment code (.html file) and video stimuli (.zip file) for each experiment (1-8) in our article [Predicting the Attention of Others](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2307584120?af=R). 

To run a version of the experiment, go into the relevant folder, unzip the stimulus zip file(s) then double click the `.html` file to open the experiment in your default web browser. 

Note that to fully replicate our procedure, you should use Firefox version 44.0.2 (downloadable here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/44.0.2/) on Mac OS X 10.11. In different browsers & systems, the experiment may display significantly differently. For example, in our experiment, the browser did not allow participants to end a trial without submitting answers, the browser displayed the experiment at around 60 frames per second, and so on. In different browsers, these and other aspects may differ (e.g., Safari allows participants to bypass a trial without entering a response -- a significant departure in the design of the experiment).
