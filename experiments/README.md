This directory contains the experiment code (.html file) and video stimuli (.zip file) for each experiment (1-8) in our article [Predicting the Attention of Others](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2307584120?af=R). 

To run a version of the experiment, go into the relevant folder, unzip the stimulus zip file(s) then double click the `.html` file to open the experiment in your default web browser. We used Firefox version 44.0.2 for mac (downloadable here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/44.0.2/). The experiment may display differently in different browsers.
