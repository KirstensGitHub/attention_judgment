# Predicting the Attention of Others

### This repository contains code pertaining to the research article Predicting the Attention of Others (under review at PNAS as of 5/23).

### It includes materials to:
- generate experiment stimuli (`./stimuli`)
- run the experiments (`./experiment`)
- analyze the resulting data (`./analysis`)

as well as the anonymized data from our study `./analysis/data`

### If you want to view our video stimuli:
- download the repository
- in `predicting_attention/experiments/` go to the folder for the specific expeirment you're interested in
- unzip the zip file you find in that folder
- go into the unzipped folder and play the mp4 files you find there

### If you want to try the experiment yourself (e.g. experiment 1):
- download the repository
- go into the `expeirments` folder
- go into the folder for the experiment of interest (e.g. `experiment_1`)
- unzip the .zip folder there (e.g. `STIM_SET_1.zip`)
- double click on the html file (e.g `experiment_1.html`)
- the experiment should pop up in your web browser :)
- NOTE: on some experiment screens, the experiment should display videos for you to watch. If the videos do not display and/or you instead see a blank white screen, open the `.html` file and check if the file paths need updating
