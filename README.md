# Predicting the Attention of Others

### This repository contains code pertaining to the research article [Predicting the Attention of Others](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2307584120?af=R).

### It includes materials to:
- generate experiment stimuli (`./stimuli`)
- run the experiments (`./experiment`)
- analyze the resulting data (`./analysis`)

as well as the anonymized data from our study `./analysis/data`

### If you want to view our video stimuli:
- download the repository
- in `predicting_attention/experiments/` go to the folder for the specific expeirment you're interested in
- unzip the zip file you find in that folder
- go into the unzipped folder and play the mp4 files you find there

### If you want to run the experiment yourself (e.g. experiment 1):
- download the repository
- go into the `experiments` folder
- go into the folder for the experiment of interest (e.g. `experiment_1`)
- unzip the .zip folder there (e.g. `STIM_SET_1.zip`)
- double click on the html file (e.g `experiment_1.html`)
- the experiment should pop up in your web browser :) 
- NOTE: To replicate our procedure, use Firefox version 44.0.2 (downloadable here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/44.0.2/) on Mac OS X 10.11. In different browsers & systems, the experiment may display differently. For example, in our experiment, the browser did not allow participants to end a trial without submitting answers, the broswer displayed experiment at a frame rate of around 60 fps, and so on. In different browsers, these and other aspects might differ. Safari, for example, allows participants to bypass a trial without entering a response -- a significant departure in the design of the experiment.)
- NOTE: If the videos do not display and/or you instead see a blank white screen during the experiment, open the `.html` file in a text editor (e.g. Atom, TextEdit, etc.) and check if the file paths need updating
